# Generate bite content using long LLM

The idea is to leverage long context of LLM to embed a book to generate some bite length articles for myself. 
For example, I could embed Deep Dive into Python course transcript or Operating System books, let the AI model generate 
one article for me to read when I am on a subway or lunch time. Send the content by email or wechat.

It will be nice if the model knows what you know or what you do not know, or what you want to read. This is personal AI teacher.
